This tool is able to receive multiple datasets (optionally with their metadata) in a single query. As an extension of the [galaxy-json-data-source](https://github.com/mdshw5/galaxy-json-data-source) tool, it allows to handle archives (gz, bz2, tar, and zip) organizing their content in a collection. 

For a detailed description of the tool please refer to the following repo:
